Term: Definition
--------

- Example: An instance (with its features) and a label.

- Feature: A property of an instance used in a prediction task. For example, a web page might have a feature "contains the word 'cat'".

- Feature Column: A set of related features, such as the set of all possible countries in which users might live. An example may have one or more features present in a feature column. A feature column is referred to as a “namespace” in the VW system (at Yahoo/Microsoft), or a field.

- Instance: The thing about which you want to make a prediction. For example, the instance might be a web page that you want to classify as either "about cats" or "not about cats". Label: An answer for a prediction task ­­ either the answer produced by a machine learning system, or the right answer supplied in training data. For example, the label for a web page might be "about cats".

- Label: An answer for a prediction task ­­ either the answer produced by a machine learning system, or the right answer supplied in training data. For example, the label for a web page might be "about cats".

- Metric: A number that you care about. May or may not be directly optimized.

- Model: A representation of a prediction task. You train a model on examples then use the model to make predictions.

- Objective: A metric that your algorithm is trying to optimize.

- Pipeline: The infrastructure surrounding a machine learning algorithm. Includes gathering the data, putting it into tabular form, training models, and exporting the models to be used in other systems.
