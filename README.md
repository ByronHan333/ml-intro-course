Course Description
----

This course focuses on the implementation and application of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using Python and related libraries. Students learn to properly select features and evaluate model accuracy. Models include at least kNN, naive Bayes, random forests, and clustering.

Learning Outcomes
----

By the end of the course, you should be able to:  

1. Apply fundamental machine learning models and methodology to solve real-world problems. 
1. Write idiomatic Python code to model data. 
1. Explain common regression, classification and clustering algorithms.
1. Build an end-to-end machine learning model.

| Item           | Weight |  
|:---------------|:------:|
| Participation  | 10%    | 
| Quizzes        | 30%    | 
| Labs           | 30%    |
| Final Project  | 30%    |

### Attendance & Participation
 
Attendance is mandatory. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify your instructor by Slack in advance. Supporting documents (e.g., doctor‚Äôs notes) should accompany absences due to sickness.

You must show up to each session prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random not to put you on the spot but to keep you engaged in the material at all times.

### Quizzes

Weekly quizzes will be held __every week (including first week) on Thursdays from 8:55 am to 9:45 am__. They are intended to test your understanding of the materials. This includes recent material and items from previous classes. There are 3 parts: individual, small-group, and class

1. Each student will answered all the questions on the quiz individually.
1. Then the class will split into teams of 3-4. Each team will answer the same questions again, the goal is to reach consensus. This is an opportunity for peer-to-peer instruction which is often more effective than just hearing me prattle on!
1. Finally, the answers to the questions will be gone over by the class, hopefully resolving any remaining misunderstandings.


### Labs

The labs will be hands-on activities. They will require a combination of coding and writing. The coding sections will be implementing algorithms from scratch or applying common libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, nltk, and keras). The writing sections will focus on communication to technical and nontechnical audiences.

Late assignments will only be accepted for medical emergencies.

Grading standards
----

Course grades range from "A" to "F". The MSDS program considers a grade of "A" to represent exceptional work with respect to both the instructor's expectations and peer student achievements. I consider an "A" grade to be above and beyond what most students achieve. A grade of "B" represents the expected outcome, what is called "competence" in a business setting. A "C" grade represents achievements lower than the instructor's expectations for competence in the subject. A grade of "F" represents little or no work in the course.

Students with disabilities
-----

If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact [USF Student Disability Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds) (SDS) for information about accommodations.

Behavioral Expectations
----

All students are expected to behave in accordance with the [Student Conduct Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter) and other University policies.

Academic Integrity
-----

USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's [Honor Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/).

Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
-----

CAPS provides confidential, free [counseling](https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-health-safety/caps) to student members of our community.

Confidentiality, Mandatory Reporting, and Sexual Assault
-------

For information and resources regarding sexual misconduct or assault visit the [Title IX](https://myusf.usfca.edu/TITLE-IX) coordinator or USF's [Callisto website](http://usfca.callistocampus.org/).
