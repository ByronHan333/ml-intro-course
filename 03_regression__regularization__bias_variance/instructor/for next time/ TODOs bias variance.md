From a model perspective, we need to consider what additional data does to the existing model. If a model suffers from a high bias, more data will not be able to improve test results beyond a limit unless more features are added.

What is avoidable bias?
    The difference between the training error and the minimum error rate.

Adding features (predictors) tends to decrease bias, 
at the expense of introducing additional variance.
